# ObjectDetection
Object detection typically uses different algorithms to perform this recognition and localization of objects, and these algorithms utilize deep learning to generate meaningful results.  Deep learning object detection is a fast and effective way to predict an objectâ€™s location in an image, which can be helpful in many situations.
